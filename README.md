```

## Running the Application

1. Start the Flask server:

```bash
uv run main.py
```

2. The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

## Running Tests

```bash
uv run python -m pytest
```

## Data Storage

The application uses a `db.json` file as both its database and sample data. This file contains two main sections:

- `users`: Stores user information
- `books`: Stores book information

Important notes about data storage:

- No additional database setup is required
- The `db.json` file serves as both the sample data and the database
- All operations (create, update, delete) will modify this file directly
- Make sure to keep a backup of this file if you want to preserve your data
- The file is automatically updated with every operation that modifies data

## API Documentation

The API is documented using OpenAPI/Swagger specification. You can find the complete API documentation in `swagger.yaml`. The documentation includes:

- Detailed endpoint descriptions
- Request/response schemas
- Authentication requirements
- Error responses
- Example requests and responses

### Base URL

All API endpoints are prefixed with: `http://localhost:8080/api/v1`

### Authentication

The API uses a simple header-based authentication:

- Header: `user_id`
- Required for: Book reservations and user-specific operations

### API Endpoints

}
```

## Using Swagger Documentation

The API documentation is available in Swagger/OpenAPI format. Here's how to use it:

1. **Viewing the Documentation**:

   - Open `swagger.yaml` in a text editor to view the raw specification
   - For a better experience, use an online Swagger editor:
     - Visit [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/)
     - Copy and paste the contents of `swagger.yaml`
     - The documentation will be rendered in an interactive format

2. **Interactive Testing**:

   - In the Swagger Editor, you can:
     - View all available endpoints
     - See request/response schemas
     - Test API endpoints directly from the interface
     - View example requests and responses

3. **Understanding the Documentation**:

   - Each endpoint is documented with:
     - HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
     - Path parameters
     - Query parameters
     - Request body schema
     - Response schemas
     - Authentication requirements
     - Example values

4. **Using the Documentation**:

   - Click on any endpoint to expand its details
   - Use the "Try it out" button to test endpoints
   - Fill in the required parameters
   - Execute the request and view the response
   - Copy the generated curl command for use in your application

5. **Common Sections**:
   - `/books`: Book management endpoints
   - `/users`: User management endpoints
   - `/reservations`: Book reservation endpoints

Note: When testing endpoints that require authentication, make sure to include the `user_id` header in your requests.

## Frontend

The application includes a modern, user-friendly web interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The frontend provides the following features:

1. **Book Management**

   - View all books in a table format
   - Add new books
   - Delete books
   - Reserve and cancel book reservations

2. **User Management**

   - View all users
   - Add new users
   - Edit user information
   - View user's reserved books

3. **Reservation Management**
   - View reservations by user ID
   - Cancel reservations
   - See reservation status for each book

### Using the Frontend

1. Start the Flask server:

   ```bash
   uv run main.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to:

   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

3. The interface is divided into three main sections:

   - Books: Manage the library's book collection
   - Users: Manage user accounts
   - Reservations: View and manage book reservations

4. **Authentication**

   - For operations that require authentication (like reserving books), you'll be prompted to enter your user ID
   - Make sure to keep track of your user ID after creating an account

5. **Features**
   - Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices
   - Real-time updates when making changes
   - Clear status indicators for book availability
   - Intuitive navigation between different sections
   - Modal forms for adding new books and users
   - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

## Notes

- The application runs on `localhost:8080`
- No authentication is required, but users must provide their `user_id` in the request headers
- The system prevents deletion of reserved books
- All endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1`
- For detailed API documentation, refer to `swagger.yaml`
